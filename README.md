### General information
The Streamlit Football Table app showcases Kraków's Class A Group 3 football league. From a formal point of view, this is the 8th football league in Poland, if you count from Ekstraklasa (the highest level of football competition in Poland).
As you can see it is a more amateur level, but we have a team with young players mainly from our academy.

### Dataset
The dataset contains a table with each team's position, wins, losses, draws and goals.
The table is linked to a graph where you can find the position of the team related to the number of matches played. Each point shows the position after matches of round 1, 2, 3 and is updated after each league round.
